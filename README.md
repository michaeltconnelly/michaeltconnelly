# Michael T. Connelly

Hello, and welcome! My name is Mike Connelly, and I am a marine biologist that studies cnidarian genomics to examine innovations in early animal evolution, and to reveal how host-microbe interactions impact key evolutionary processes. My overarching goal is to generate discoveries that can be translated to improve human and ecosystem health.
