# Michael T. Connelly

Hello, and welcome! My name is Mike Connelly, and I am a marine biologist that studies cnidarian genomics to examine innovations in early animal evolution and  reveal how host-microbe interactions impact key evolutionary processes. I am committed to using advanced computational techniques and my deep knowledge of evolutionary biology, immunology, and microbiology to develop new algorithms and uncover insights from 'omics data. My overarching goal is to generate discoveries that can be translated to improve human and ecosystem health.
